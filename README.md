# PushupCounter

Simple weekend hack project for a pushup counter app. 

## Usage 
- Count sets with '+/-' buttons
- Tap 'mark today done' when you hit your goal
  - Check calendar view for days you've 'completed' ( completed can be whatever you want )
- To use the TrueDepth auto counting mode:
  - Place phone on floor with screen facing up
  - Toggle the 'face tracking' switch 
  - Do pushups with face over the screen
  - Check the debug graph for the estimated face distance ( values might need some tuning ) 

## Notes
- Built in SwiftUI
- TrueDepth camera auto counter mode - WIP
  - I tried using face detection, but it was unreliable in weird lighting conditions, so switched to raw depth
